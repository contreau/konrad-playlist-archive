# The Konrad Rauscher Playlist Archive

Between 2013 and 2024, my late friend Konrad Rauscher crafted 846 public Spotify playlists (technically 855, but 9 are empty) containing a total of 64,782 songs.

Konrad was perhaps the biggest supporter of my interest in coding and was a big reason I became a developer. It's only appropriate for me to leverage code in order to preserve such an immense, cherished collection of music that he constantly shared with his family and countless friends over the last decade.

This repository includes the essential data of all 846 playlists, in both JSON and CSV formats, as well as the script I wrote to retrieve and organize it. The following example illustrates one playlist in JSON format.

```
[
  {
    "name": "Regens Unite",
    "id": "3V4ZE7VXTKJIKkNknpH220",
    "followers": 7,

    "trackCount": 13,
    "tracks": [
      {
        "name": "Chamallow",
        "artists": ["Polo & Pan"],
        "album": "Carrossel Do Tempo",
        "url": "https://open.spotify.com/track/6mdGfjrWlzVxcHcqbOVN3q",
        "dateAdded": "2024-04-21T08:28:41Z"
      },

      /* More tracks, etc. */
    ]
  }
]
```

More work is underway to create a true visual interface for anyone to explore his epic curation.

Rest in Peace, Konrad &#x1F499;
