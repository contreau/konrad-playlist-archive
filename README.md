# Konrad Rauscher Playlist Data Archive

Between 2013 and 2024, my late friend Konrad Rauscher crafted 826 original public Spotify playlists containing a total of 59,903 songs.

Konrad was perhaps the biggest supporter of my interest in coding and was a big reason I became a developer. I'm grateful that I can help preserve such an immense, cherished collection of music that he constantly shared with his family and countless friends over the last decade.

This repository includes the essential data of all 826 playlists, in both JSON and CSV formats, as well as the Python script I wrote to retrieve and organize it.

The web app of Konrad's epic curation now lives at [komp3nd1um.app](https://komp3nd1um.app).

The following example illustrates one playlist in JSON format:

```
[
  {
    "name": "Regens Unite",
    "dateCreated": "04-21-2024",
    "url": "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3V4ZE7VXTKJIKkNknpH220",
    "trackCount": 13,
    "tracks": [
      {
        "name": "Chamallow",
        "artists": ["Polo & Pan"],
        "album": "Carrossel Do Tempo",
        "url": "https://open.spotify.com/track/6mdGfjrWlzVxcHcqbOVN3q",
      },
      /* ...etc. */
    ]
  }
]
```

Rest in Peace, Konrad &#x1F499;
